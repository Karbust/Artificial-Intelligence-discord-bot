# Artificial Intelligence


## Getting Started

I won't help you to fix errors, or code something you want. Use this or nothing! If the code is outdated, please ask someone to create a pull request.


### Installing

Install [nodejs & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

copy [example.secrets.json](example.secrets.json) and change the bot token to the bot token you get from [the discord developer page](https://discordapp.com/developers)

then (if you have) put the top.gg webhookAuth & Name in it (leave empty ("webhookAuth": "" and "webhookName": ""))

then run

```
npm i
```

To install all packages and then

```
node .
```

to stop the bot, press ctrl + c in the terminal (it takes some time to stop showing the bot online in discord but it won't respond)

next time you want to run the bot you only have to do

```
node .
```
